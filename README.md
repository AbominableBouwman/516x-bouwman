## Human Reaction Time
Whenever you see something there is a slight delay before you can react to it. The delay is measurable and variable across many different factors such as race, sex, age, and a variety of environmental factors. The current research is to test the impact of different input methods as a signifigant impact factor for individual reaction time.

## Testing Methods  
Data is being collected using a module created on Scratch which is an free game/programing tool is designed and maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the [MIT Media Lab](https://scratch.mit.edu/about). This module was designed and created by Elijah Bouwman as part of a project for Industrial Engineering 577: Human Factors. The module provides the participants an ID used to track their data across attempts. The modules then asks participants to choose an input or control method from a list of three: Mouse, Keyboard, Touch Screen. The module then shows a red screen and after a minumum of two seconds the screen will light up green and ask the participant to interact with the screen. The time the green screen is visiable is logged in milliseconds and the test is repeated until  five successful data points have been gathered. The testing process is repeated for each method of control, a total of 15 times. 

The module is puplically available at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/579740360/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/579740360/) (This module is not currently finished)

The participants are then asked to provide the participant ID given to them at the begining in a google forum to collect summary data points such as race, sex, age, and familiarity with technology.

- [Data Processing](This will go to the Processing notebook)
- [Data Exploration](This will go to the Exploration notebook)
- [Model Prediction](This will go to the Visualization notebook)

(Data scraping Python Script/Export the collected data here)
The reaction times are each logged in a seperate cloud variable and can be collected from various URL's assocaited with the module. These can be grabbed with a python script and stored in a usable format.
